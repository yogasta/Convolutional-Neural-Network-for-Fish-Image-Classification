# Fish-Image-Classification
Fish Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (TensorFlow)
The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient image classification model for fish species identification, using deep learning (CNN) and transfer learning techniques. This project can be a valuable tool for marine biologists, the aquaculture industry, and researchers, allowing them to automate the fish classification process and gain insight into fish population dynamics, biodiversity, and ecological research. 

In this project, we managed to achieve an accuracy score 99%.
